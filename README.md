## SQL queries performed

Performed sql queries on Twitter tweet counts in order to manipulate the data to determine multiple different questions provided by Maven Analytics.  The first questions answered was which category has the least amount of tweets which was Philanthropic.  Also the category with the greatest amount of tweets is Personal Growth.  This is no surpirse which is evident by the number of increased gym memberships in January.

The data was then further manipulated to determine which state had the greatest number of tweets and was visualized in Tableau.
